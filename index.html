            <h1>About Fatuma Restaurant</h1>
            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the <br> industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br> scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br> electronic typesetting, 
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br> Letraset 
                sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
                like <br> Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
